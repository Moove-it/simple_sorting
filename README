= SimpleSorting

SimpleSorting helps to make sorting more easier for Rails. It provides sorting over column's model and over associated models.

When sorting by associated models it includes objects who doesn't are associated, btw uses LEFT JOINs not INNER JOINs like searchlogic does.

At this moment it's not possible to chain sorting calls because named scopes doesn't support sort chaining. At Rails 3.0 that behaviour may change.

== Install & Use

Install as a plugin:

  $> script/plugin install git://github.com/snmgian/simple_sorting.git
  
  Move to the plugin directory and run the tests
  $> cd vendor/plugins/simple_sorting
  $> rake

  If all tests passed you're ready.


== ActiveRecord Example

* Sorting by a column's model:

    Person.asc_by_name # People set sorted by name in ascending order

    Person.desc_by_age # People set sorted by age in descending order


* Sorting by an associated model in a :belongs_to association:

    Person.asc_by_planet_name # People set sorted by theirs planet's name in ascending order

    Person.desc_by_planet_name # People set sorted by theirs planet's name in descending order


* Sorting by an associated model in a :has_one association:

    Person.asc_by_tie_color # People set sorted by theirs tie's color in ascending order

    Person.desc_by_tie_color # People set sorted by theirs tie's color in descending order

        
== View and Controller Example

* The following renders a link that will pass in the request the parameters for sorting. The sorting direction is extracted from the request params or defaults to 'asc'
    sort_link 'Name', 'name'

* The following render a link to sort by the associated tie's color
    sort_link 'Tie', 'tie.color'

* In the action method simply call to simple_sorting passing the ActiveRecord finder and a Hash with the :sort_dir and :sort_field params
    @people = simple_sorting(Person, params)
